    "conventional geothermal resources where fluid is rising buoyantly through the crust to form a reservoir that can be intersected by drilling. Where there is sufficient temperature to discharge with the energy of boil or hydrostatic head, wells will self-discharge. Otherwise, wells are pumped. The liquid reservoir is typically hot hydrostatic (i.e., at a lower pressure than the regional cold hydrostatic gradient). We do not discuss engineered geothermal systems, which are also referred to as 'hot dry rock', or the low-temperature sedimentary aquifer systems. However, the testing methods used in those settings are similar to what is described in this tutorial. \n",
